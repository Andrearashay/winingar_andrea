# Homework 2 Part 6: Lists
# 6.1 Introduction to Lists
# 6.2 Create A List
# Numeric vector with numerics from 1 to 6
numeric_vector <- 1:6
# Logical vector with TRUE and FALSE
# The `rep` function replicates objects you pass to it.
# In this case, you're replicating TRUE FALSE four times.
logical_vector <- rep(c(TRUE, FALSE), 4)
# letter Matrix with the first nine letters of the English alphabet
letter_matrix <- matrix(LETTERS[1:9], ncol = 3)
# First 10 elements of the chickwts data frame
chicks_df <- chickwts[1:10,]
# Use the `list()` function to create `the_list` with the above objects. Use the names of the objects to name the objects. 
the_list <- list(numbers = numeric_vector, boolean = logical_vector, letters = letter_matrix, chicks = chicks_df)
# Display the contents of `the_list`
the_list
# Display the structure of 'the_list'
str(the_list)
#
# 6.3 Extract Elements from a List
# Add the line to create the horsebean vector
hb_chicks <- chickwts$weight[1:10]
# Add the line to create the linseed vector
ls_chicks <- chickwts$weight[11:20]
# Create a list object with the results of the t-test.
chicks_t <- t.test(hb_chicks, ls_chicks, var.equal = TRUE)
# Run the `str()` function on `chicks_t` 
str(chicks_t)
# Display the numeric value of the `statistic` object from `chicks_t`
chicks_t["statistic"]
# Display the numeric value of the `p.value` object from `chicks_t`
chicks_t["p.value"]
# Display the lower confidence limit
chicks_t$conf.int[1]
# Display the upper confidence limit
chicks_t$conf.int[2]
# Create a text string called `Whew` with the value "I did it!"
"Whew" <- "I did it!"
